Multiple linear regression model on simple dataset: 

                      Although theoritically multiple linear regression is compicated coompared to simple linear
regression as the deoendent variable is dependent on multiple variables and requirement of backward elimination 
almost unsignificant independent variables.Building a multiple linear regression model using sci-kit learn is 
similar to simple linear regression model as sci-kit learn takes care of the above mentioned complexities by 
default when it recognises multiple independent variables
