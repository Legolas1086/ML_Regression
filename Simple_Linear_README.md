# Simple_Linear_Regression
A simple linear regression model on a simple dataset:
     A simple linear model establishes a linear relationship
     between dependent(y) and independent(x) variables. The accuracy of the model
     is high in simple_linear_better compared to the other because of shuffling 
     the data to remove orderness in the data so the model establish better 
     linear relationship between dependent and independent variables.
     This shows the importance of shuffling the ordered data. Shuffling is not necesssary for 
     unordered data.
